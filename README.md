# car-bot

The goal of this project is a functional autonomous vehicle. It will then be optimised for real-world scenarios, which has unpredictable environments.

Vision:
- Lane recognition
  - Straight
  - Curved, broken
- Obstacle detection
  - Other vehicles (cars, bikes, trucks)
  - People and animals
  - Objects
- Traffic signs recognition
  - Traffic lights
  - Traffic signs (stop, give way)
- Scene perception

Autonomous decision system:
- Local path planning
- Global path planning
- Behaviour decision
  - When to stop (E.g. no need to stop for a plastic bag, need to stop for a person/animal)
  - Accelerate/Decelerate
  - Steering
